# ModularBoost
ModularBoost: An efficient network inference algorithm based on Module Decomposition
## Explanation for the datasets and code
Cruted, PIDC, SCODE, and DREAM5 datasets come from the previous work of researchers, which can be trace back to Reference [15,16,17]. It should be noted that the 'Goldmodule.txt' in the Curated and SCODE datasets are gold standard of module detection. They were extracted by graph theory or community detection methods.
We provide code for gene module detection, including ICA-FDR, ICA-FDR2, ICA-zscore, PCA and K-means.
