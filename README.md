# ModularBoost
ModularBoost: An efficient network inference algorithm based on Module Decomposition
## Explanation for the datasets
Cruted, SCODE, and DREAM5 datasets come from the previous work of researchers, which can be trace back to Reference [15,16,17]. It should be noted that the 'Goldmodule.txt' in the Curated and SCODE datasets are gold standard of module detection. They were extracted by graph theory or community detection methods.
